 <h1>Shimmer Effect Loading in Flutter</h1>
    <p>This project demonstrates how to implement a shimmer loading effect in a Flutter application. The shimmer effect is used as a placeholder while content is being loaded, providing a smooth and visually appealing user experience. Once the loading is complete, the actual content (products list) is displayed.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulates a loading effect using the <code>Shimmer</code> package.</li>
        <li>Displays a product list after a simulated delay.</li>
        <li>Reusability of components for both shimmer placeholders and actual product items.</li>
        <li>Optimized with <code>const</code> where applicable for better performance.</li>
    </ul>
